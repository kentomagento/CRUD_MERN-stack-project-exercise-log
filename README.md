## Notes

Connecting the rest api to the controller page was challenging, having a test page to confirm the basic CRUD functions was a great benefit before moving on to the react portion. 
Middleware functions took longer than expected to implement, was able to get it working after several hours.
Final steps completed, however, date format isn't strict as it should be, and maybe add a dropdown for lbs/kg units.
